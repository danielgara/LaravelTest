<div class="divider divider-right"><a href="#" data-scrollto="#faqs-list"><i class="icon-chevron-up"></i></a></div>

<h3 id="faq-3"><strong>Q.</strong> Does your store offer alteration/tailoring service?</h3>
<p class="justified">No, we do not offer alteration (e.g. hem pants length, etc) service.</p>

<div class="divider divider-right"><a href="#" data-scrollto="#faqs-list"><i class="icon-chevron-up"></i></a></div>

<h3 id="faq-4"><strong>Q.</strong> I live near your office. Can I visit your store first before purchase?</h3>
<p class="justified">No. The address in the item listing page is our sales office and only opens for business customers and retailers. Currently we do not have a store open for retail customers.</p>

<div class="divider divider-right"><a href="#" data-scrollto="#faqs-list"><i class="icon-chevron-up"></i></a></div>

<h3 id="faq-5"><strong>Q.</strong> Can I return the suit I purchased if I am not satisfied with it and how to do it?</h3>
<p class="justified">Yes. The suit must be in its original condition with tags attached. You must notify the seller at suitsusa@gmail.com and return the suit within 7 days after you receive the suit. When you return, please include the original packing slip and include a note that you would like to return it, and return to our company address in the item description page of the listing.
    Refund will be made within 7 business days after returned item is received. The Seller is not responsible for any missing or damaged package so we suggest you would use a method that would provide tracking and insurance options (e.g. USPS priority or UPS ground).</p>

<div class="divider divider-right"><a href="#" data-scrollto="#faqs-list"><i class="icon-chevron-up"></i></a></div>

<h3 id="faq-6"><strong>Q.</strong> Can I exchange for a different size or item if it’s not fit or if I do not like it, and how to do it?</h3>
<p class="justified">Yes. As described in the return question above, the suit must be in its original condition with tags attached + $25 check under our company name. You must notify the seller and return the suit within 7 days after you receive the suit. When you return the package, please include the original packing slip and include a note that you would like to exchange for a different size or item, and return to our company address in the item description page of the listing. Exchange will be made within 7 business days after returned item is received.
     Again, the Seller is not responsible for any missing or damaged package so we suggest you would use a method that would provide tracking and insurance options (e.g. USPS priority or UPS ground). As a common practice, the Buyer will pay his own shipping charge to send the item back to the Seller; the Seller will send the replacement at the Seller’s expense by UPS ground.</p>

<h3 id="faq-7"><strong>Q.</strong> What Is Your Shipping Policy?</h3>
<p class="justified">We do not believe in stuffing expensive garments into mail bags and sending them out with a stamp. We believe our items are expensive, high quality garments and deserve to be treated well and shipped with care. This is why we use new boxes and every item is placed in new 2mil thick ziplock plastic bags to protect it during it's journey. We send most of our items out by UPS with tracking. If shipping to a PO box USPS will be used and for some lighter weight items (under $5.95 S&H). We reserve the right to choose which mailing service we will use. 
    One can expect to receive your package within 2-7 business days, but it ultimately depends on the time and day of your payment and on the service of UPS.
<br /><br />
All payments must be received before items can be shipped. All items listed are in stock but occasionally we use drop-shippers. We normally ship packages out every weekday morning after 12 noon so often your purchase will ship within 12 hours or less! If you need your package sent out any quicker, Please email us to let us know and we will do our best to accommodate you. Special request must be made by email, be very specific and will require a verification from us that we agree. Please do not make any assumptions about our service we will always respond kindly to all emails and requests.
